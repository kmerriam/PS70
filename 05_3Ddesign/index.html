<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>
So I had a very hard time with this. It was so very annoying because PrusaSlicer seems to be allergic to my computer.
But, Bobby helped me download another app called UltiMaker Cura so I was not able to print my object before class but I designed a cable holder that I will attach to my bed. 
I hate having to pick up my cables and they just look very messy on the floor so I want to have a device that holds them for easy access and for prettier storage.

I tried scanning my turtle shaped eraser, however I think that was too small. Next, I tried to do a scan a sharpie. For some reason that also seemed to be shiny.
Alas I was running out of time so I resorted to scanning the Ceasar head.

  Here is my 3-D model of my final project.
